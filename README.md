# BetterNotesAttachmentsPermissions
<p><strong>Update | 12-30-17</strong></p>
<p>-Note Permission Checking functioning</p>
<p>-Attachment Permission Checking WIP </p>

<p>Small project to create granular Note & Attachment Permissioning tools. SF is pretty limited as far as this goes. Standard Note/Attachment permissions are a glorified on-off switch without any middleground. This will change that.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong><p>
<p> I am using <strong>Custom Settings of the Hierachy Type</strong> to handle the permission toggling</p>

<p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>
<p>Intuitive Permission Management for Notes and Attachments</p>
<p>Triggers to prevent certain operations on Attachments depending on a Profile/User's ID and the user's selected Permission level</p>
<p>e.g. Insert, Update, Deletion permissions correspond with the relevant Trigger on-fire actions</p>
