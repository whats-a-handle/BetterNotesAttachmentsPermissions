# BetterNotesAttachmentsPermissions
<p>Small project to create granular Note & Attachment Permissioning tools. SF is pretty limited as far as this goes with an on-off switch for Note/Attachment permissions per profile.</p>

<p><strong>Goals:</strong></p>
<p>Intuitive Permission Management for Notes and Attachments</p>
<p>Triggers to prevent certain operations on Attachments depending on a Profile/User's ID and the user's selected Permission level</p>
<p>e.g. Insert, Update, Deletion permissions correspond with the relevant Trigger on-fire actions</p>
