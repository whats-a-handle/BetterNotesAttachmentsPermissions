# BetterNotesAttachmentsPermissions
Small project to create granular Note & Attachment Permissioning tools. SF is pretty limited as far as this goes with an on-off switch for Note/Attachment permissions per profile.

Goals:
Intuitive Permission Management for Notes and Attachments
Triggers to prevent certain operations on Attachments depending on a Profile/User's ID and the user's selected Permission level
e.g. Insert, Update, Deletion permissions correspond with the relevant Trigger on-fire actions
